Questions:

If we are trying to model this as a producer consumer problem, can we
say that the worker is the consumer and the north/south bound threads
are the producers?

When will the worker thread get blocked?
* When there are no cars at either lane
* We want to context switch when there are 10 cars on the other lane

When will the northbound thread get blocked?
* When the worker is asleep
* When the southbound thread is letting cars through

When will the southbound thread get blocked?
* When the worker is asleep
* When the northbound thread is letting cars through

What are the race conditions?
* North and south queue

Should we use the STL queue to keep track of the cars on either side
so that we have access to size() instead of using a linked list?

Should we use one mutex lock for both queues of cars?
